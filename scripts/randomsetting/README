Installation
============

To build the random setting generator, simply type "make [OPTIONS]" using
the same options as for your SCIP build.  Make sure that SCIP is built with
these options beforehand.  To run the program, it suffices to build with
"make LPS=none ZIMPL=false READLINE=false GMP=false ZLIB=false" such that no
external libraries are needed.


Usage
=====

The binary takes a non-negative random seed as an optional parameter (using
zero if none is given) and writes a random setting file named

   <githash>-<seed>.set

to the same directory.  You can use the command

   make RUNS=<number of setting files to be created> test

to automatically create a series of setting files with current timestamp as
seed value.
