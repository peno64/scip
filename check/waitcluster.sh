# In order to not overload the cluster, no jobs are submitted if the queue is too full
# instead, this script waits until the queue load falls under a threshold and returns
# for the calling script to continue submitting jobs.

# The cluster queue QUEUE has an upper bound of LIMIT jobs; if this limit is
# reached the submitted jobs are dumped; to avoid that we check the total
# load of the cluster and wait until it is safe (total load not more than
# LIMIT jobs or we have submitted less than LIMITQUEUE jobs) to submit the next job.

# Usage example: ./waitcluster.sh 1600 "${QUEUE}" 200
